Java 8 features:


Default methods in Interface:

 - Before Java 8 we can only add abstract methods in interface. But in Java 8 they introduced default methods in interface where we can execute method logic
   in the interface.
 - It is not necessary to override default methods. 
 - It will be like default for the classes which implements it. If we want to change the logic of the method in any classes we can override now and 
   implement the method logic in the class.
 - Example: We have Student interface which has studentName() as abstract method and studentDress() as default method. We also have two classes
   NurseryStudent and PrimaryStudent which implements the Student interface. As usual the abstract method will be overridden by each classes and that is not a 
   problem here. The default method studentDress() has a print statement as "Uniform". Now in the Nursery they are allowed to wear color dress. So override 
   the default method and add "Color Dress" in NurseryStudent class. Now the NurseryStudent object will be calling the overridden method whereas the 
   PrimaryStudent object will use the defauld method.

Static methods in Interface:

 - We can also declare static methods inside interface. But this static method cannot be overridden in implementation class.
 - If we want to call the static method in interface we have call with interface name(Ex. Interface.staticMethod()).
 - We can also have main method inside interface and execute. It will execute and will not show compile time error.


Method Reference:

 - Method reference is used to refer method of functional interface.
 - It is compact and easy form of lambda expression.
 - The biggest advantage of using method reference is CODE REUSABILITY. Because we can declare method logic once and the method in the functional interface 
   can refer to the declared method whenever needed without duplicating the code.
 - The referenced method should have the SAME ARGUMENTS as the method in the functional interface.
 - Types of Method Reference:
	1.Reference to a static method.
	2. Reference to an instance method.
	3. Reference to a constructor.

 - Eg(referring to instance method): 
	Interface Student{
		public void m1();
	}
	Class NurseryStudent{
		public void studentMethod(){
			System.out.println("Hi Nursery Students");
		}
	}
	Class Main{
		public static void main(String []args){
			NurseryStudent ns = new NurseryStudent(); // creating instance 
			Student student =  ns :: studentMethod;   // referring the instance method to the method in function interface
			student.m1();
		}
	}
 - Here when calling student.m1(), m1() refers to the studentMethod(). Instead of implementing the functional interface method, we are referring to the 
    method which is already declared. We are reusing the existing method code here.

 - Eg(constructor reference):
	Interface Student{
		public NurseryStudent get();
	}
	Class NurseryStudent{
		NurseryStudent(){
			System.out.println("Hi Nursery Students");
		}
	}
	Class Main{
		public static void main(String []args){
			Student student  = NurseryStudent :: new;
			student.get();
		}
	}
 - Here the functional interface has a method which has return type NurseryStudent. The method get() is referred to the constructor of the NurseryStudent.
   So when we call the get method it is referring to the constructor.
