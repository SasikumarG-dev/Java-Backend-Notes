Version Control System:

 * VCS is a tool that helps you manages the source code.
 * It tracks modification, revert to previous versions, collaborate with team members.
 * A version control system is a kind of software that helps the developer team to efficiently communicate and manage(track) 
   all the changes that have been to the source code along with the information like who made and what changes have been made.

Key Concepts:

	- Repository: The storage location for your project’s files and their version history.
	- Commit: A snapshot of changes made to the files. Each commit has a unique identifier.
	- Branch: A parallel version of the project. Branches allow you to work on features or fixes independently of the main codebase.
	- Merge: The process of integrating changes from one branch into another.
	- Conflict: Occurs when changes in different branches affect the same part of a file and need to be resolved manually.

Types:
i)  Centralized Version Control System
	- It contain just one repository globally and every user need to commit one’s changes in the remote repository.
	- Other can view their commits and they can update in their working copy of the project.

				  Repository
 				 //          \\
			 commit // update     \\
			       //  	       \\
			 Working copy      working copy

ii) Distributed Version Control System
	- It contain one global repository and multiple local repositories cloned in our local machine.
	- Committing in our local repository will not be visible to others unless we push that in Remote or Global repository.


				   Repository
 				 //          \\
			   push	// pull       \\
			       //  	       \\
			 Local Repo        Local Repo
			     //			 \\
		      commit//update		  \\
			   //			   \\
			Working copy         Working copy


Popular VCS:

* Git (DVCS)
* Subversion (CVCS)
* Mercurial (DVCS)


Before VCS:

1. Manual Backup 
	- copying in floppy disc, some drives, etc...
2. Handwritten Logs
	- File modification logs are handwritten like who did the modification for specific files.
3. Manual merging
	- If two developers worked on same file, they have to sit together to resolve the changes on that file manually.
